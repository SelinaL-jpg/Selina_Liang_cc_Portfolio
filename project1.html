            <p class="reflection">
                When I received this assignment and saw the mention of seconds, the first thought that came to mind was "Mississippi." I often hear people use "Mississippi" to measure a second when counting. So, I thought of creating a Mississippi timer, where every second a "Mississippi" would randomly appear on the screen, and every minute the counter on the left would increase by one. It was relatively simple to implement â€” I made the word randomly appear somewhere on the right side of the screen each second, with random sizes and angles.

                However, I quickly realized that it looked too monotonous, and after a while, the screen would get too crowded. So, I decided to make the font randomly switch between outline and filled styles. Additionally, I made it so that each new "Mississippi" would appear at 100% opacity, and then gradually fade out until it disappeared. To improve the aesthetic, I loaded some fonts, and in the end, it turned out quite well.
